  you pick up the vehicle using your phone and don&rsquo;t need to

  somewhere and move away before you collect it.</p>

  Keep your vehicle clean between bookings (Car)</b></font></h3>
  <p lang="en-GB">here are a few tips on how to clean your car and
  protect your drivers:</p>
  <p><strong><span lang="en-GB">Protect yourself</span></strong>&nbsp;<span lang="en-GB">-
  Wear gloves to protect your hands from any harsh chemicals &amp;
  avoid touching your face until you have washed your hands. Keep your
  windows and doors open whilst you are cleaning to make sure you don&rsquo;t
  breathe in any harmful chemicals.</span></p>
  <p><strong><span lang="en-GB">Use a disinfectant</span></strong><span lang="en-GB">:
  Make sure your cleaning products are designed to kill viruses -
  natural ingredients don&rsquo;t have the power to effectively remove
  coronavirus from surfaces so opt for something containing bleach.
  Watch out for your seats, some bleaches can damage your seat
  coverings so make sure you take extra care around leather and fabric.</span></p>
  <p lang="en-GB">Focus on the major touch points:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><span lang="en-GB">Door

    </p>
  </ul>
  <p><em><span lang="en-GB">This isn&rsquo;t to say the rest of your
  car doesn&rsquo;t need a clean!</span></em></p>
  <p><strong><span lang="en-GB">Remove dirt &amp; dust</span></strong><span lang="en-GB">:
  Viruses can hide on all surfaces, this includes dirt and dust so make
  sure you clean your car thoroughly. That includes vacuuming the
  carpets, seats and roof-lining. Top Tip: Use an old toothbrush to get
  into all those little hard to reach places.</span></p>
  <p><strong><span lang="en-GB">Keep sanitizer or some wipes in your
  glove box</span></strong><span lang="en-GB">: We ask all drivers to
  clean down the major touchpoints after their hire but if you leave
  some wipes they are more likely to clean the car and make sure it&rsquo;s
  safe for you.</span></p>`;
